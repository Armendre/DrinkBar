# 🍹 DrinkBar – Frontend Drinks Ordering Website

DrinkBar is a modern **frontend-only web application** focused on online drinks ordering.  
The project was originally developed as a restaurant ista website and has been **fully transformed and rebranded into a DrinkBar concept**, dedicated exclusively to beverages.

This project was created as part of my training with **MakerMinds**, where I completed my studies and earned certification in Front-End Development.
